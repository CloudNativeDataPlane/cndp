Ring PMD
========

Allows the creation of pseudo ethernet devices by providing PMD APIs to a fixed
size, lockless, multi/single producer, multi/single consumer FIFO (CNDP Ring)
that behaves as if it was a physical NIC. This allows for the running of CNDP
applications without any ethernet devices, instead a pair of CNDP rings can be
used.

Enqueuing and dequeuing items from a CNDP ring using the rings-based PMD may be
slower than using the native rings API. This is because CNDP Ethernet drivers
make use of function pointers to call the appropriate enqueue or dequeue
functions, while the CNDP ring specific functions are direct function calls in
the code and are often inlined by the compiler.
