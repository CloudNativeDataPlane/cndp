Compiling the Sample Applications
=================================

Sample applications are built automatically as part of the CNDP build. For more information please
see the :ref:`Building CNDP <building-cndp>` section.

.. note::

   Some samples, such as :doc:`dlb<dlb_test>`, ibroker, and cnet-quic, are only built if the
   build system has necessary software and/or hardware dependencies.
