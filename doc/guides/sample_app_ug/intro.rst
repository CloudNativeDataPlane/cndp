Introduction to the CNDP Sample Applications
============================================

The CNDP Sample Applications are small standalone applications which
demonstrate various features of CNDP. They can be considered as a cookbook of
CNDP features.  Users interested in getting started with CNDP can take the
applications, try out the features, and then extend them to fit their needs.


Running Sample Applications
---------------------------

Some sample applications may have their own command-line parameters described in
their respective guides.


The CNDP Sample Applications
----------------------------

There are many sample applications available in the examples directory of CNDP. These examples
range from simple to reasonably complex but most are designed to demonstrate one particular
feature of CNDP. The least interesting example is highlighted below.

* :doc:`Hello World<hello_world>`: As with most introductions to a programming framework a
  good place to start is with the Hello World application. The Hello World example sets up
  the CNDP Environment Abstraction Layer (CNE), and prints a simple "Hello World" message
  on each of the CNDP enabled threads. This application doesn't do any packet forwarding but
  it is a good way to test if the CNDP environment is compiled and set up properly.

There are many more examples shown in the following chapters.
