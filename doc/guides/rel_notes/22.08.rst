CNDP Release 22.08
==================

New Features
------------
* TCP stack support added to CNET (Experimental)
* Go bindings and API restructure
* Rust bindings and API restructure
* MsgChan library added for message passing between threads and Go to C code
* Ring library supports user-allocated memory to prepare for multi-process
* Pktmbuf library supports external metadata to prepare for larger metadata needed for IPv6
* GitHub Actions for unit tests, clang-format, and linting
* Update VPP CNDP plugin to run on VPP 22.02
* Fedora 35 container support
* Updates for libbpf 0.5.0, and 0.8.0
* Support for libxdp 1.2.0
* Fuzz tests for log, mempool, and mmap libraries
* Unit tests for cne, metrics, and cthread libraries
* Logical port group fixes in json parser
* Updates to memif PMD
* Header fixes for C/C++ compilation

Notable Changes
---------------
* Experimental TCP stack support is added to CNET.
* Go and Rust bindings and API are restructured to be consistent with Go package and Rust crate
  naming conventions.

Known Issues
-------------
* CNET stack assumes a single IP address per logical port, which means a 1:1 mapping between IP
  address and hardware queue. This is counter-intuitive to the way IP addresses are typically
  assigned, where a single IP address is assigned to a device which has many queues.

Limitations
------------
* Still need to use a full netdev (Physical Function) with CNDP at this time. Support for
  Virtual Functions and Sub-devices will follow in later releases.
