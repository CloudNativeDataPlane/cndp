CNDP Release 21.09
==================

New Features
------------
* **Added WireGuard Rust example**
* **Added Metering library**
* **Added Json validator schema**
* **Added CPU and interface scanning in the pod to generate CNDP configuration on the fly**
* **Added CNDP Device Plugin and CNI**
* **Added Unprivileged CNDP Pod support**

Some notable changes
--------------------
* The CNDP pod no longer needs privilege to create and use AF_XDP sockets.

Known Issues
-------------
* None

Limitations
------------
* Still need to use a full netdev (Physical Function) with CNDP at this time. Support for
  Virtual Functions and Sub-devices will follow in later releases.
* Ethtool support is not yet enabled in the CNI and device plugin. As such, it's recommended
  to use a small pool of devices for the CNDP netdev pool and pre-configure the ethtool rules
  on the netdev.


Tested Platforms
----------------
* **Intel® Server System R2000WF Family**


Tested NICs
------------
#. **Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation Ethernet Controller X710 for 10GbE SFP+ (rev 01)**
